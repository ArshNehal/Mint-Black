A sleek and functional To-Do List web application with task persistence, intelligent filtering, timestamp tracking, theme switching, and a polished user experience.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Core Functionality & Persistence

- **Completion Checkbox**: Easily mark tasks as complete with a single click.
- **Refined Remove Button**: Aligned and styled to match the completion checkbox, maintaining a clean UI.
- **Todo Layout**: Tasks are grouped with action buttons and timestamps using Flexbox for perfect alignment.
- **Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode)**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes with a responsive toggle button.

### 🧰 Code Quality & Maintainability (Planned/Optional Enhancements)
- Modular JavaScript using classes or ES6 modules.
